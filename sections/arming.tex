\section{Arming}

Arming messages are used to advance the current level of arming in the pad control system. Many arming sequences must
take place remotely from the control input box at the ground station, hence their inclusion in the specification.

There are two message types for arming: the arming request and the arming acknowledgement. All arming requests are to
be responded to with an arming acknowledgement indicating the status of the request.

\subsection{Arming Request}

\textbf{Level:} The arming level that the client is requesting be moved to. A list of valid arming levels can be found
in Table \ref{tbl:arming-levels}.

    \begin{tabular}{| c | c | p{4in} |}
        \hline
        \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Value} & \textbf{Description}                                                               \\
        \hline
        NONE          & 0              & The pad control system is not armed at all.                                        \\
        \hline
        VALVES        & 1              & The pad control system is able to actuate solenoid valves.                         \\
        \hline
        IGNITION      & 2              & The pad control system is able to actuate ignition circuitry and fire valve motor. \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Valid arming levels}

\subsection{Arming Acknowledgement}

\textbf{Status:} The status of the arming request which this message is acknowledging. A list of valid statuses can be
found in Table \ref{tbl:arming-statuses}.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{| c | c | p{4in} |}
        \hline
        \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Value} & \textbf{Description}                                                                  \\
        \hline
        OK            & 0              & The arming request was processed and the pad control system has changed arming level. \\
        \hline
        BAD\_PERM     & 1              & The arming request could not be completed because the current arming level is
        not high enough for that level progression.                                                                            \\
        \hline
        INV           & 2              & Invalid arming level.                                                                 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
