\section{Telemetry} \label{sec:telemetry}

All telemetry messages are designed to be sent over UDP using multicast functionality. This will allow the server
implementation to send a single UDP message which can be delivered to all subscribers.

In addition, the use of the UDP protocol is well-suited for telemetry applications. Measurements are made and
transmitted multiple times in a tenth of a second. It is not worth the overhead of TCP to have acknowledgements for
each of these messages, since if one is lost many will follow and the information will become obsolete quickly.

The multicast address for telemetry is \texttt{224.0.0.10}, using port \texttt{50002}.

\subsection{Measurements}

The hybrid control system measures three key pieces of information:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Temperature
    \item Pressure
    \item Mass
\end{enumerate}

These measurements give the operator insight into whether or not the system is becoming unstable, if filling is
proceeding nominally, etc.

All measurements are only temporally valid, so they must be associated with a time stamp indicating the time of
measurement.
