\section{Arming Logic}

The control logic that the pad server uses to govern which actuation and arming commands are valid at any given time
are based on the arming state in Figure 13.

The quick disconnect is an actuator which upon being switched "on", forcibly disconnects the ground systems plumbing
from the oxidizer tank on board the rocket. This operation cannot be reversed.

The igniter is a small piece of solid fuel with nichrome wires running through it. Once it is turned "on", high current
is sent through the nichrome wires, igniting a flame underneath the fire valve. This action cannot be reversed.

The main fire valve is a single valve that when opened, allows the oxidizer to flow out of the oxidizer tank on the
rocket and into the combustion chamber. It will flow out of the nozzle on the combustion chamber on to the lit igniter,
initiating lift-off. This action \textit{obviously} cannot be reversed!
