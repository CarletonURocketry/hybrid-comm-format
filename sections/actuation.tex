\section{Actuation}

The pad control system is composed of several actuators which need to be controlled from the control input box at the
ground station.

All of the actuators on the system are binary actuators with only an "on" or "off" state.

Actuators will be assigned a unique numerical ID agreed upon by all nodes on the network.

All actuation requests must be responded to with an actuation acknowledgement indicating the status of the command.

\subsection{Actuation Request}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \begin{bytefield}{16}
        \bitheader{0-15} \\
        \bitbox{8}{ID}
        \bitbox{8}{State} \\
    \end{bytefield}
    \caption{Actuation request format}
    \label{format:actuation-req}
\end{figure}

\textbf{ID:} The unique numerical identifier associated with the actuator who this request is destined for.

\textbf{State:} The state to put the actuator in. Valid states are \texttt{0} for \texttt{OFF} and \texttt{1} for
\texttt{ON}.

\subsection{Actuation Acknowledgement}

        \bitbox{8}{Status} \\
    \end{bytefield}
    \caption{Actuation acknowledgement format}
    \label{format:actuation-ack}
\end{figure}

\textbf{ID:} The unique numerical identifier associated with the actuator who this acknowledgement is from.

\textbf{Status:} The status of the request that is being acknowledged. Valid status are listed in Table
\ref{tbl:actuation-statuses}.

        DNE           & 2              & The actuator ID is not associated with an actuator.                  \\

        INV           & 3              & An invalid state was requested.                                      \\
