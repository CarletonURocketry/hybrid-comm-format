\section{Introduction}

The hybrid control system used by CU InSpace requires network communication between nodes. The nodes consist of a
control input box at the ground control station, the pad control system at the rocket's launch pad and a user interface
that can be placed anywhere with connection to the network.

There are three primary forms of messages that are sent over the network:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Measured data from the sensors on the pad control system.
    \item Control signals for actuating valves and motors on the pad control system from the control input box.
    \item Arming signals for initiating each stage of the arming procedure.
\end{enumerate}

This specification provides the description of the structure for each of these message types and their valid messages.

It should be noted that this specification is designed under the assumption that all messages are sent using TCP over a
local network.

All fields are to be assumed as having little-endian byte ordering unless specified otherwise.
